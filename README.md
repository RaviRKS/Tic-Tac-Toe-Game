Introduction:
The "Tic Tac Toe Game" project is a simple yet classic implementation of the popular game known as Tic Tac Toe. This project is built using web technologies such as HTML for structuring the game board, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for implementing the game logic and interactivity. Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their own marks (either "X" or "O").

Project Objectives:
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

Create a Playable Game Board: Design and implement a visually appealing game board using HTML and CSS that consists of a 3x3 grid where players can place their marks.

Implement Game Logic: Use JavaScript to handle the game's logic, including keeping track of player turns, validating moves, and determining the winner.

Enable Player Interaction: Implement user interactions so that players can click on empty squares to place their marks.

Display Game Status: Display relevant information such as the current player's turn, the winner of the game, or a tie state.

Add Styling and Visual Feedback: Enhance the user experience by adding CSS styling to the game board, highlighting winning combinations, and providing visual feedback for player actions.

Handle Game Over Scenarios: Implement logic to detect when the game is over due to a win or a tie, and provide options for restarting the game.


Technologies Used:

HTML: Used for creating the structure of the game board, buttons, and text elements.

CSS: Utilized for styling the game board, buttons, and adding visual effects.

JavaScript: Implemented to handle the game's logic, user interactions, and updating the game state.
